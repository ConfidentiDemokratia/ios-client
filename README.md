# iOS Mobile client with Web3, Blockchain, and SwiftUI

## Introduction

This README.md provides an overview of developing an iOS mobile native client app integrating Web3, blockchain technology, and SwiftUI framework for user interface development.

## Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI**: SwiftUI is a modern framework provided by Apple for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms.
- **Web3**: Web3 is a set of libraries and protocols used for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows developers to integrate blockchain functionalities into their applications.
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum blockchain will be used for this project. Ethereum is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Xcode: Make sure you have the latest version of Xcode installed on your macOS system.
- Swiftformat: SwiftFormat is a code library and command-line tool for reformatting Swift code on macOS, Linux or Windows:

  ```
  brew install swiftformat
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Install dependencies using CocoaPods:

   ```
   touch Keys.swift
   ```
   
4. Add keys to Keys.swift:
  
   ```
   let walletPrivateKey = "0x..."
   let daoHexAddress = "0x..."
   let rpcURL = "https://..."
   ```

## Development Timeline

### 1. Transpiling Rust Project to Swift XCFrameworks with Liama

In the initial phase of development, the focus was on integrating a Rust project into our iOS app. Leveraging the Liama tool, we seamlessly transpiled the Rust codebase into Swift-compatible XCFrameworks. This step ensured smooth interoperability between Rust and Swift, laying a solid foundation for blockchain integration.

### 2. Configuring Wallet Connection with Swift-Web3Modal Library

Next, we directed our efforts towards enabling wallet connectivity within the iOS app. By leveraging the Swift-Web3Modal library, we streamlined the process of connecting users' wallets to the application. This facilitated secure transactions and interactions with the Ethereum blockchain directly from the mobile app interface.

### 3. Web3 Integration using Web3.swift Library

Building upon the established wallet connectivity, we proceeded to integrate Web3 functionalities into our iOS app. Utilizing the powerful Web3.swift library, we seamlessly interacted with smart contracts, retrieved blockchain data, and executed transactions. This step was crucial for unlocking the full potential of decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain.

### 4. Unification of Technologies for a Unique Result

Finally, we unified the transpiled Rust components, wallet connectivity, and Web3 integration to create a cohesive and feature-rich iOS application. By combining these cutting-edge technologies, we achieved a unique and innovative solution that empowered users to seamlessly interact with blockchain networks, manage digital assets, and participate in decentralized ecosystems directly from their mobile devices.

This development timeline highlights the progressive integration of diverse technologies, culminating in the creation of a robust and user-centric iOS app with unparalleled blockchain capabilities.
